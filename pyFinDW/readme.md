# Entry Point to Python App

This is the top/root level ("main") our python code.
We limit how much logic we put here; ideally only a single `main.py` file that is **end user entry point into our app**.
But this also where we can out ad-hoc temp/demo code and dev new code before pushing it down into our more permananet code base: the `pyFin` folder package.

`*.py` files in this folder:
- depend on code in pyFin folder
- are meant to executed directly
